			What our customers are saying:
		</h2>

		<div>
			<p>As reported by GFYS:</p>
			<blockquote>
				They were calling it a <a href="./docs/jsdoc/symbols/atropa.xpath.html">"kitchen sink"</a>, <a href="./docs/jsdoc/symbols/atropa.CreateHtmlDocumentsFromXmlhttp.html">"steroids for script kiddies"</a>, and generaly spewing trollish B.S. So he took the idea a step further by automating their foolishness into the <a href="./docs/jsdoc/symbols/atropa.Babbler.html"><code>atropa.Babbler</code></a>. Then he let it crawl their silly forum saying <i>all sorts of relevant things</i>. That's when they realized it was more like an outhouse punt or a pudgy porn star. Sure, it might be a bit ugly and have strange protrusions on the backside but, once you see it in action... $$$$!

			What is it?
		</h2>

        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/matthewkastor/AtropaToolbox-raw-js">The Glorious AtropaToolbox</a> provides tools for automating websites in <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/"
               target="_blank">Firefox</a>, <a target="_blank"
               href="http://phantomjs.org/">phantomjs</a>, and other browsers. Providing several easy methods for creating and manipulating DOMDocument objects, The Glorious AtropaToolbox gives you flexibility in how you will retreive and manipulate data. You can operate on the visible window, in a hidden frame, in a completely separate DOMDocument object, or through the speedy magic of XMLHttpRequests. The Glorious AtropaToolbox provides a great deal of simplification in using the several methods mentioned so you can get on to doing whatever it is that you're trying to do. This toolbox goes great with phantomjs. Use The Amazing phantomjs to go crazy reading and writing to and from files, and acting as the user controlling an invisible web browser while you inject The Glorious AtropaToolbox into pages for great results!
