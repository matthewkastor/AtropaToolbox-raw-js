Tably Template Copyright 2010 Nick Rabinowitz, based on the default template in
JsDoc Toolkit, Copyright (c)2009 Michael Mathews <micmath@gmail.com>

This is an alternate template for use with jsdoc-toolkit (http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/), 
a great application for auto-generated !JavaScript documentation. The Tably template is a modified 
version of the template in the jsdocs-toolkit distribution, with the following features:

  * Heavier use of prettier tables (e.g. for class list and function parameters)
  * "Readme"-style project overview information taken from the @fileOverview in a file of your choice
  * Inclusion of inherited fields/methods in class documentation, with a link to the definer class
  * Static fields and methods broken out separately
  * JS code formatting for @example code
  * Slot for for a custom project title
  * Slot for a logo or custom image
  * Inclusion of project version information
  * Nicer display of multiple-level "config"-style parameters
  * Config variable to suppress generation of a page for the global namespace
  * Easy support for a custom index template
  * General cleanup of styles and layout
  
To use for your project:

  # Put the template folder somewhere you can find it
  # Put any image or custom template files into your project
  # Copy the SAMPLE.conf file into your project and edit as necessary
  # Run jsdoc-toolkit with the flag: -c path/to/myfile.conf
